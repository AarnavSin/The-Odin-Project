        <h1>Homepage</h1>

        <!--The anchor tag is used to add links.-->
        <a>Click me!</a>

        <!--This on its own wouldn't go anywhere. We need to add an HTML attribute, like so.-->
        <a href="https://aarnavsin.github.io/">Click me!</a>

        <!--The href attribute stands for hyperlink reference.-->
        <!--Links like the above on are called Absolute Links, they lead to links on other websites 
            on the internet.-->

        <!--Relative Links link to other pages in our own website.-->
        <a href="about.html">About</a>
        
        <!--This works because the index and about page are in the same directory. 
            That means we can simply use its name (about.html) as the linkâ€™s href value.-->

        <!--If we organise our pages better, using folders, we can link those here too, like so.-->
        <a href="./pages/otherabout.html">About Again</a>

        <!--We can display images on a website by using the <img> tag and the src attribute.
            the src attribute works much like href. Works for both absolute and relative 
            paths.-->
